## Abhi Verma
- Developed and validated the new edited safety stop function which slows down the car if there is an obstacle in front of it or fully stops it if the object is too close.
- Added improvements to obstacle avoidance by changing preprocess_lidar_scan function

## Ayden Bauyon
- Enhanced the obstacle handling module by developing the moving history of gap distances for smoother trajectory planning.
- Contributed to refining LIDAR data processing and dynamic obstacle detection to ensure timely path selection.
- Participated in testing the combined system to validate improved responsiveness.

## Armaan Braich
- Implemented key image processing components for the lap counting algorithm, including grayscale conversion, cropping, masking, binary thresholding, and morphological operations.
- Helped fine-tune the reference and subsequent image comparisons to reliably detect laps.
- Contributed to documentation and code cleanup for the image processing pipeline.

## Matthew Fung
- Assisted in integrating the obstacle handling strategies with the overall system.
- Refined the adjustments in the safety bubble function based on vehicle speed.
- Contributed to iterative testing and debugging of the obstacle avoidance strategies.

## Jason Hsu
- Improved the design and tuning of the PID controller for smoother acceleration, deceleration, and overall vehicle stability.
- Tested and fine-tuned the emergency stop logic to ensure robust and reliable operation in critical scenarios.
- Assisted in integrating the safety mechanisms with other core systems.

## Noah Ndambuki
- Managed simulation and real-world testing environments to evaluate system performance.
- Contributed to overall system optimization by identifying and resolving integration issues.
- Helped document testing strategies and results to support continuous improvements.
